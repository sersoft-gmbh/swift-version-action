# Swift Version Action

[![Tests](https://github.com/sersoft-gmbh/swift-version-action/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sersoft-gmbh/swift-version-action/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This action reads the current Swift version.

_Note_: 
    This action does not install or change the current Swift version. It just reads it.
    To change the Swift version on macOS, use `xcode-select` to select the corresponding Xcode version (or use an action like [maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode](https://github.com/maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode)).
    To install Swift on Linux, you can use our [swifty-linux-action](https://github.com/sersoft-gmbh/swifty-linux-action) action.

## Inputs

_None_

## Outputs

## Example Usage

```yaml
uses: sersoft-gmbh/swift-version-action@v1
```
